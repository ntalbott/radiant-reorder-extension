= Reorder

Modifies Radiant's page administration tool in such a way as to provide the ability to reorder
the children of a Page. Be sure to run 'rake db:migrate:extensions', then
'rake radiant:extensions:reorder:update:public'.

This extension is based on the work done by John Long in preparation for the feature to be a part
of Radiant 0.6.1. In the interest of making it available as soon as possible, it has been packaged
here for all the world to see.
