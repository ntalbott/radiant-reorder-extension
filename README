= Reorder

Created by Sean Cribbs, October 2007.  Inspired by Adam Williams' original
reorder extension.

Allows pages to be arbitrarily ordered underneath their parent.  This is useful
for creating navigations based on children of a given page.  Buttons are added
to the sitemap that allow you to move individual pages higher or lower in the 
ordering, or to the top or bottom of the list.

No drag-and-drop for now!  Keeping it simple.
